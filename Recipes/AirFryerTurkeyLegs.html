            This recipe is perfect if you're cooking Thanksgiving for just two
            people and you don't want to spend the time cooking a whole bird and
            dealing with all of the leftovers. The skin gets crispy like it has
            been deep-fried while the meat stays juicy and tender.

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
          <li>
            Whisk together olive oil, poultry seasoning, parsley, salt, paprika,
            and pepper in a small bowl until evenly combined.
          </li>
          <li>
            Brush 1/2 of oil mixture on all the sides of the turkey legs and
            place into the air fryer basket.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cook for 25 minutes. Brush the tops of the turkey legs with some of
            the oil mixture. Flip turkey legs over and brush with remaining oil
            mixture. Cook until turkey is no longer pink at the bone and the
            juices run clear, about 10 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer
            inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
